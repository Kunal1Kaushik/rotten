Minor Project of my first Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning course!
Sentiments have been predicted on a scale upto 5 for RottenTomatoes Movie reviews!
sklearn has been used to perform Logistic Regression, but this project was done in my infancy of using Machine Learning techniques, and now I am certainly more comfortable with ML!
I understand that much better results could have been achieved, but this being my first ever project, that too one which was made in a bit of a rush to meet deadlines, I am very proud of it!
